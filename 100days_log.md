# 100 Days of ML - LOG ##

## Day 0: July 5, 2018
Aware of 100 days of ML. Thought process started to find a new project, make the most of learning ML and deliver a solution.  

## Day 1: July 6, 2018
Decided to work on multiple projects, during the 100days. First up is logistic regression. I'll be implementing a Neural Network based Logistic regression. After searching for an intereseting dataset to work with. I finalized the [titanic dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic) from Kaggle. Wrote a basic script to clean up the dataset. I'll be creating and training the NN model tomorrow. This project can be tracked [here](https://github.com/Santosh-16k/Neural-Network/tree/master/Logistic_Regression).

## Day 2: July 7, 2018
Had plenty of time to work on the Logistic regression problem. I explore the dataset using pandas library and I enjoyed the library. I was initially planning for a Tensorflow implementation but I switched to a Keras based implementation due to simplicity. In all got to learn a lot. Completed the problem. Got an accuracy of 0.74641. Not the best but good one to begin with. Next, I plan to work on a linear regression problem. Let's find an interesting dataset to begin.

## Day 3: July 8, 2018
Explored more of pandas library. Read about Regression using Neural Network. Felt comfortable with Keras but plan on switching to Tensorflow in the long run. Learnt few basics commands of tensorflow.
