# 100 Days of ML - LOG ##

## Day 0: July 5, 2018
Aware of 100 days of ML. Thought process started to find a new project, make the most of learning ML and deliver a solution.  

## Day 1: July 6, 2018
Decided to work on multiple projects, during the 100days. First up is logistic regression. I'll be implementing a Neural Network based Logistic regression. After searching for an intereseting dataset to work with. I finalized the [titanic dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic) from Kaggle. Wrote a basic script to clean up the dataset. I'll be creating and training the NN model tomorrow. This project can be tracked [here](https://github.com/Santosh-16k/Neural-Network/tree/master/Logistic_Regression).
