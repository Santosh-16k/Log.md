# 100 Days of ML - LOG ##

## Day 0: July 5, 2018
Aware of 100 days of ML. Thought process started to find a new project, make the most of learning ML and deliver a solution.  

## Day 1: July 6, 2018
Decided to work on multiple projects, during the 100days. First up is logistic regression. I'll be implementing a Neural Network based Logistic regression. After searching for an intereseting dataset to work with. I finalized the [titanic dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic) from Kaggle. Wrote a basic script to clean up the dataset. I'll be creating and training the NN model tomorrow. This project can be tracked [here](https://github.com/Santosh-16k/Neural-Network/tree/master/Logistic_Regression).

## Day 2: July 7, 2018
Had plenty of time to work on the Logistic regression problem. I explore the dataset using pandas library and I enjoyed the library. I was initially planning for a Tensorflow implementation but I switched to a Keras based implementation due to simplicity. In all got to learn a lot. Completed the problem. Got an accuracy of 0.74641. Not the best but good one to begin with. Next, I plan to work on a linear regression problem. Let's find an interesting dataset to begin.

## Day 3: July 8, 2018
Explored more of pandas library. Read about Regression using Neural Network. Felt comfortable with Keras but plan on switching to Tensorflow in the long run. Learnt few basics commands of tensorflow.

## Day 4: July 9, 2018
Learnt about Convolutional Neural Network

## Day 5: July 10, 2018
Explored the mathematics of Neural Style Transfer

## Day 6: July 11, 2018
Attended Intel's Seminar on Object Classification using Movidius. Learnt a lot about the amazing device. I'll start with Neural Style Transfer, starting tomorrow.

## Day 7: July 12, 2018
Attended Seminar on Deep Reinforcement Learning. I'll be implementing this some time in the near future.

## Day 8: July 13, 2018
Went through Inception Model on Coursera. Took time to understand the architecture and its working.

## Day 9: July 14, 2018
Implemented Neural Style Transfer. Took help from Coursera's homework to implement.[repo](https://github.com/Santosh-16k/Neural-Network)

## Day 10: July 15, 2018
Was experimenting with Neural Style Transfer. Changed different parameters and was noticing the changes between them.

## Day 11: July 16, 2018
Read about YOLO algorithm. Planning to implement YOLO using transfer learning.

## Day 12: July 17, 2018
Have started reading through tensorflow notebooks. Learning more about it to efficiently implement deep learning algorithms.[Source](https://github.com/Hvass-Labs/TensorFlow-Tutorials)
